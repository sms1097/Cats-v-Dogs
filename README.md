# Cats-v-Dogs
This is uses a basic CNN to relatively accurately classify cats and dogs from the kaggle dataset.
This model was trained over 75 epochs and achieved just about 94% accuracy. 
Future work for this includes making a more robust image movement folder function for `flow_from_directory`, as well as comparing results with transfer learning.
